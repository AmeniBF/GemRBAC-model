GeRBAC-model
============
This project has been developped at the SVV lab (http://www.svv.lu) of the University of Luxembourg (http://wwwen.uni.lu) by Ameni Ben Fadhel (http://wwwen.uni.lu/snt/people/ameni_ben_fadhel).

In this project, we present the implementation of the GemRBAC model, a generalized model for Role-based Access Control that supports the various types of the following RBAC policies:
* Prerequisite constraint
* Cardinality constraint
* Precedence and dependency constraint
* Role hierarchy constraint
* Separation of duty constraint (SoD)
* Binding of duty constraint (BoD)
* Role delegation and revocation constraint
* Context constraint

#Content
This project contains:

1. The GemRBAC model: RBACmodel.ecore
2. The formalization of RBAC policies as OCL constraints: constraints.ocl
3. An instance that satisfies all the RBAC policies: validModel.xmi
4. For each RBAC policy, an instance that violates it.

#Requirements
* Ecore Tools (http://download.eclipse.org/ecoretools/updates/)
* OCL Tool
